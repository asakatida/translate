# Kiaska

This is a translator that takes in a word or sentence of any language, consisting of any ascii character, and translates it into a semi-pronounceable but unreadable version of the language.  The end translation was designed to easily be able to be converted back to legibility with ease to any person with a legend, but be difficult to write code for a computer to decipher it.

## Application

This was originally made to be a quick and easy fake language creator for books and games.  Simple enter what is to be said in a known language and out pops something new for you to use.
